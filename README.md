# The Wordle Solver That Stole My Dad's Joy ðŸ–¤

## Description

Wordle Solver is a simple web-based tool designed to help players find possible words in the popular word game Wordle. The page takes input for letters that are in the correct position, letters in an incorrect position, and letters that are wrong. It then filters a list of English words and sorts them based on their commonality to give the user a list of possible words that match the conditions.

## Background Story (How I Turned Family Time into a Coding Duel)

So, there I was, visiting my old manâ€”a former software engineer at Sun Microsystems. He was all excited about this Wordle game. You know Wordle, right? The game that's turned into everyone's new procrastination tool? Yeah, that one.

Anyway, pops had cooked up a neat little Java program to solve Wordles. A day's work, he said, beaming with pride as if he'd just solved world hunger. Clearly, he was living his best retired life.

## The Plot Twist: Introducing ChatGPT, the Joy Thief

Ah, but you see, I had an ace up my sleeve. I decided it was time to introduce him to the brave new world of AI and ChatGPT. And what better way to do that than to completely annihilate his accomplishment?

Sorry, dad. Your Wordle solver is neat, but watch me (or rather, ChatGPT) whip up something even fancierâ€”in about 20 minutes.
